tags: meal, gf, df

ingredients:
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup long grained brown rice
- 3 1/2 cups chicken broth, divided
- 1/3 cup pesto
- 1 to 1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise
- Salt and pepper, to taste



directions:
- In a microwave safe dish, stir together the onion, butter, garlic, rice and 1/2 cup broth.
- Microwave for 4 minutes, stirring every 90 seconds.
- Transfer to a greased slow cooker.
- Stir in the remaining 3 cups of broth and the pesto. Nestle the chicken into the slow cooker.
- Cover and cook on HIGH for about 3 hours.  (mine took exactly 3 hours…yours may take more or less depending on your slow cooker)
- Stir and break up chicken with a spoon. Salt and pepper to taste.
- Serve immediately (this tastes best served right away, it doesn’t hold up very well on the warm setting)
