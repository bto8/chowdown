- 1 bell pepper, green
- 1-2 clove garlic
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 chilli / jalapeño
- 5-6 sun-dried tomatoes in oil (drained)
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- ½ cup water
- 1 cup brown lentils, cooked (1 cup = 1 can 15oz/400g)
- 1 can kidney beans (1 can = 15oz/435g)

- 1 can tomatoes (1 can = 14 oz/400g)
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp cumin

- 1 avocado (for garnish)


directions:
- Dice the onion, garlic, bell pepper, chilli and dried tomatoes into small pieces. Then throw all these ingredients into a pan with oil and fry them for 3 minutes on a low heat.
- Add the broth and water, rinsed and drained beans, lentils, sweetcorn and chopped tomatoes and stir well.
- Add the tomato paste and season with salt, pepper, cumin, paprika powder and oregano. Really nice if you add maple syrup. Let it all simmer on medium heat for 20 mins, stirring occasionally.
- Season with salt and pepper and serve with rice, toasted bread on the side, a dollop of (vegan) sour cream and sliced avocado if desired.
