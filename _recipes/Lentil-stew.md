tags: meal, lunch, light,spicy, vegan, gf, df

ingredients:
- ½ cup red lentils, dried
- ½ cup rice
- 2 cloves garlic
- ½ medium onion
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 cups vegetable broth
- 2 cups water
- ½ tsp cumin
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp sweet paprika (smoked paprika also works nicely)
- ⅛ tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 tsp thyme, dried
- 3 tsp olive oil
- salt to taste


directions:
- Put the cumin and cayenne pepper into a large pot and toast it slowly (no oil).
- In the meantime, dice the garlic and onion.
- When the cumin begins to smell (after 2 or 3 minutes usually), add the olive oil, garlic and onion. Let it cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Add the tomato concentrate, the red lentils, rice, the vegetable broth and water.
- When it begins to boil, add the turmeric, bay leaf and thyme. Cover and let simmer gently for 20-25 minutes. Stir every few minutes. Have a quick taste test to make sure the rice is cooked to your liking. Add the salt, remove well and turn off the heat. Add the paprika and serve.**
