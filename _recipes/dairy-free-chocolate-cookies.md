title: Chocolate Cookies - Dairy Free
tags: sweet, vegan, gf, df

ingredients:
- ¾ cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
 - ½ cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder
 - 1 teaspoon baking soda
 - ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
 - ½ cup pure cane sugar (or granulated sugar)
 - ¼ cup coconut sugar (or lightly packed brown sugar)
 - ½ cup melted coconut oil, cooled slightly*
 - 1 large egg
 - 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
 - 1 cup dairy free chocolate chips
 - flaky sea salt, for sprinkling (optional)


directions:
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. 
- In a large bowl, whisk together the cane sugar, coconut sugar, coconut oil, egg and vanilla for about 30 seconds.
- Slowly add in the flour mixture in two batches and mix until just incorporated (this will take a little bit of arm power). Fold in the chocolate chips.
- Transfer the bowl to the refrigerator and chill for 30 to 45 minutes, until the dough is well chilled but not so hard that you can’t scoop it. {For me, this is right around 38 to 40 minutes, but it can vary based on your fridge and even the mixing bowl you’re using.}
- Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350ºF. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Scoop about 1 ½ to 2 tablespoons of the chilled dough (I use my large cookie scoop) and drop on the prepared baking sheet about 2 to 3 inches apart. Sprinkle the tops lightly with some flaky sea salt if using.
- Bake for about 9 to 11 minutes, until the edges are just set (don’t over bake these!). 
- Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
