title: Banana and Oats Bites
tags: sweet, vegan, gf, df

ingredients:
- 1 ripe banana
- 40ml / 1/4 cup orange juice
- 75g / 1 cup rolled oats


directions:
- Preheat the oven to 170c / 340f and line a baking tray with parchment paper or a non stick silicone sheet.
- Mash the banana in a bowl with a fork. Add the orange juice and mix well. Then add the oats and mix together until everything is well combined.
- Take one tablespoon of the oat mixture, shape into a round cookie shape and place on the baking tray. Repeat with the remainder of the mixture. I made 11 bites from this.
- Bake in the oven for 10 minutes. Allow to cool on a wire rack.
