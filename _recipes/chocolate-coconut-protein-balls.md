title: Chocolate Coconut Protein Balls
tags: sweet, vegan, gf, df

ingredients:
- 1/2 cups dates
- 1/4 cups chopped walnuts
- 5 tablespoons raw cacao powder
- 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 1 cup shredded coconut
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 2 tablespoons warm water (if needed)

directions:
- To make the Batter: Place the dates in a bowl of warm water for twenty minutes to soften. While they're soaking, grind the walnuts in a food processor. Leave a few chunks for texture.
- Add the dates to a food processor and rough chop until combined (but a few walnut chunks still remain).
- If mixture is too thick, add 1-2 tablespoons warm water slowly and keep blending. You may need to pause and scrape down the sides. The mixture will be very sticky.
- Scrape your date/walnut batter into a large mixing bowl.
- Add to bowl: 5 TB raw cacao powder, 1/4 cup + 2 TB shredded coconut (make sure you still have about 2/3 cup set aside for rolling later) and 3 TB maple syrup. Mix with a fork until everything is combined and "wet looking". The mixture should be sticky.
- To Make the Protein Balls: Line a large plate or cutting board with parchment paper. Pour the rest (about 2/3 cup) of the shredded coconut onto another plate. Place coconut oil in a small bowl next to your work area.
- Grease your hands with a bit of coconut oil, grab some of the date mixture and roll it into a ball (about one inch in diameter). 
- Once rolled, place the ball into the plate of coconut and sprinkle/roll it all about pressing down to make sure it sticks. Place the coconut covered ball onto the parchment paper.
- Repeat until you run out of batter (makes 18-20 balls).
- Allow to set in freezer for 20-30 minutes. Store in an airtight container.
