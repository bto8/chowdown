title: Sausage Hot Pot
tags: meal, gf, df

ingredients:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 500g beef and cracked pepper sausages (see note)
- 2 brown onions, halved, sliced
- 1 red capsicum, cut into thick strips
- 2 cups jasmine rice, rinsed
- 400g can diced tomatoes
- 2 1/2 cups Massel chicken style liquid stock


directions:
- Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan over medium-high heat. Add sausages. Cook, turning often, for 5 minutes or until browned. Remove sausages to a board. Thickly slice.
- Reduce heat to medium. Add remaining oil, onions and capsicum to pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes or until soft. Add rice, tomatoes, stock and sausages. Stir to combine. Bring to the boil.
- Cover pan and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Set aside, covered, for 15 minutes (this allows rice to complete cooking). Season with salt and pepper. Spoon hotpot into serving bowls. Serve.
