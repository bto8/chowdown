title: GF DF Donuts
tags: sweet, vegan, gf, df

ingredients:
- 1 cup gluten-free flour blend
- ⅓ cup brown sugar, packed
- 1 teaspoon gluten-free baking powder
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon gluten-free vanilla
- ¼ cup + 2 tablespoons avocado oil (or oil of choice)
- ¼ cup + 2 tablespoons dairy-free milk (or regular milk)
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- FOR THE COATING:
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
-1 teaspoon cinnamon

directions:
-For the donuts: Preheat oven to 425°F. Grease one six-serving donut pan; set aside.
- In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
- Add the egg, vanilla, oil, dairy-free milk, and vinegar and stir until combined.
- Spoon the batter into the prepared donut pan - filling each donut well about ⅔ full. The batter should not cover the center of the donut well where the hole will go.
- Bake for 9-11 minutes or until the donuts rise and set.
- Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes.
- Place a wire rack over a cookie sheet or piece of parchment paper.
- Carefully remove the donut from the pan. You may need to use a spoon or a rubber spatula to loosen them if they stick.
- For the coating: In a separate small mixing bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon. One at a time, dip the tops of your donuts into the coating, then flip them to coat the bottoms.
